Building on this from [Drupal Community](https://www.drupal.org/conflict-resolution), which was remixed from [Django Conflict Management Manual](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/enforcement-manual/).

The notion of a 'ladder' is that each time we take an action (ban, warning) the individual is made aware of future consequence.  That's not to say that someone cannot jump right to a perminant ban, or that we can't jump 'two' steps in the ladder.  Rather, it's a way of communicating escalation.  

### No Action
Recomendations do not indicate violation of CPG

### Simple Warning Issued
* A private, written warning from project leadership, with **clarity of violation, consequences of continued behavior**.

### Warning + Mediation
Recommendations indicate a violation of CPG through a single incident or series of actions that create toxicity in the community. Mediation provides opportunity to provide perspective, gain empathy, and steps for resetting behavior.
